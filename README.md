A project on Texas motor vehicle crash reports in 2016.
Will be using the data to determine the areas with the most crashes.
Need to review the data for more questions to ask.
Data is from the TxDOT Public Crash Interface Data.
There are 46097421 missing values in total for this data set.
There are too many columns to remove in the full csv file. Will use a spreadsheet to remove the colunns not
needed and then use the updated csv to work on.
Will look at crash data from 2016 and a pull from 2021 in another data set.
