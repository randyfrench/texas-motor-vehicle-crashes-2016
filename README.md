A project on Texas motor vehicle crash reports in 2016.
Data is from the TxDOT Public Crash Interface Data.
Used a CSV file to remove columns not needed. Data frame is more managable now.
Which locations in Texas have the most deadly crashes?
Which locations in Texas have the most non-deadly crashes?
Is there an average speed of deadly crashes?
