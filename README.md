A project on Texas motor vehicle crash reports in 2016.
Will be using the data to determine the areas with the most crashes.
Need to review the data for more questions to ask.
Data is from the TxDOT Public Crash Interface Data.
There are 46097421 missing values in total for this data set.
Need to remove columns not needed to clean up missing values.
